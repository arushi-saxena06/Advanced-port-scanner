# Advanced-port-scanner
Advanced Python port scanner with multithreading for fast scanning, banner grabbing, colored output, and progress tracking. Scans custom or preset port ranges, identifies open ports, fetches banners, and logs results. Enhanced from my previous port scanner for better performance and deeper network analysis.
